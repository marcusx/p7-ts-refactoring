With the following test, we would like to assess your programming aptitude with regards to your knowledge of programming techniques and your methodic approach.

We ask you to refactor the ‘AddCustomer’ method in the CustomerService class in order to make the code easier to maintain and to test.

You can change anything (method signatures, constructors, structure, etc.). Feel free to use the internet to look up anything you need.

Please consider identifier naming styles, design patterns, modularity, and SOLID principles.

To help us assess your thought process, you may provide comments to clarify your reasoning and design decisions.

We will assess
- Whether your solution (TYPESCRIPT) is correct, in that it works and produces valid results
- How testable it is
- The solution's structure and design
- Clarity and Redundancies

We will not assess the performance of the solution
